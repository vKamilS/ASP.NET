# Introduction 
It's a WEBAPP where you can create an account, add and menege your posts and view posts of other Users.

Also in App I use authorizasion for diffrent type of users.

For frontend I used HTML, Javascript, VUE + VUEtify.

For backend I used C#, ASP.NET CORE and EntityFramework.

# Getting Started
Microsoft SQL Server must be installed before running the App. It is needed to create database with users. The databse will be created automatically after starting the App. First created user will be Administrator and any other user will be Standard user.
